Project name: Online Store LapShop

Description
==============
Oneliner: Onlineshop for students, young adults and others who wants to buy
computers.

LapShop is a online store where users can browse new computers from our assortment.
They can login and add computers to their shopping carts, and check them out if they
find a computer they like.

We are planning to have a store manager who can send out exclusive offers to registered
customers. This store manager can also add and remove items from our assortment, and
manage complaints and reviews from customers.

The Admin for our site will have all the same rights as the store manager, but will also
have exclusive rights to add and remove store manager privileges.
Our sales pitch is directed to students, who we like to give a 15% discount on
computers.
